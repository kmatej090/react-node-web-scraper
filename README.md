# React Nod Web Scraper

This project is a web scraper that consists of a client and a server. The client was bootstrapped with Create React App, and the server uses Express.js, Axios, Cheerio, and Puppeteer for web scraping.

## Project Structure

The project has two main folders:

- `client`: This is where the front-end code resides.
- `server`: This contains the back-end code for the web scraper.

## Server

The server is an Express.js application that uses Axios for making HTTP requests, Cheerio for parsing HTML, and Puppeteer for browser automation.

### Install Dependencies

#### `npm install`

### Available Scripts

In the server directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the server in development mode with nodemon.

## Client

The client was bootstrapped with Create React App. 

### Available Scripts

In the client directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about running tests for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
